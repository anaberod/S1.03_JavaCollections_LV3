# üìÑ Description - Exercise Statement

Create an application capable of reading a CSV file.  
The file contains three fields for each record: first name (`nom`), last name (`cognom`), and ID (`DNI`).  
The goal is to read the data from the file and sort the persons by their first name, last name, or DNI.  
You can use any list structure you find most appropriate.

The `Person` class must have three attributes: `firstName`, `lastName`, and `dni`.

The main class must display the following menu:

1. Add a new person.
2. Show persons sorted by first name (A-Z).
3. Show persons sorted by first name (Z-A).
4. Show persons sorted by last name (A-Z).
5. Show persons sorted by last name (Z-A).
6. Show persons sorted by DNI (ascending).
7. Show persons sorted by DNI (descending).
0. Exit.

The program should list the persons in a format similar to:

| First Name | Last Name | DNI |
|------------|-----------|-----|
| Andreu | Ballestero Llenas | 34835767J |
| Miquel | Bayona Font | 48743957B |
| Guillem | Capdevila Riu | 33957834J |
| Albert | Carbonell Ferrer | 77364986R |
| Ferran | Casas Coderch | 23047848P |
| Maria | Casellas Fuste | 47102244S |
| Genis | Ciutat Vendrell | 39718459N |
